✨ Pokédex ✨

This project is for learning purposes only.

The goal is to practice using JavaScript and to learn how to work with data from an external API. The data is fetched from the PokéAPI and displayed dynamically in the browser.

The project focuses on:

- working with fetch and asynchronous JavaScript

- understanding and handling API data

- dynamically updating the DOM

- basic responsiveness and user interaction
